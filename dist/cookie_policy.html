          We may change this Cookie Policy at any time.  Please take a look at the “LAST REVISED”
          date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any change

          <h2>1. What Is A Cookie?</h2>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small text file (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to a
            user’s browser from a website's computers and stored on a user’s computer's hard drive
            or on a tablet or mobile device (collectively, “<strong>Computer</strong>”). A Cookie stores a small
            amount of data on your Computer about your visit to the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use “web beacons” (also known as “clear GIFs” or “pixel tags”) or similar
            technologies on our Site to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or
            received a message. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although
            it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an email or other type
            of message, which is retrieved from a remote website on the internet enabling the
            verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A web
            beacon helps us to understand whether you came to our website from an online
            advertisement displayed on a third-party website, measure successes of email marketing
            campaigns and improve our website performance. They may also enable us to relate your
            viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including
            your personal information. In many instances, web beacons rely on cookies to function
            properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We place and access Cookies on your Computer; these Cookies are known as “first-party
            Cookies.” Cookies may also be placed and accessed by some of our third-party vendors,
            which are known as “third-party Cookies” and are described below. Some Cookies are
            "session Cookies," which means that they are temporary Cookies that are only stored on
            your device while you are visiting our Site. Other Cookies are "persistent Cookies,"
            which means that they are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our
            Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can choose whether to accept Cookies by changing the settings on your browser.
            However, if you disable this function (or keep this function disabled, as set by default
            by certain browsers), your experience on the Site may be diminished and some features
            may not work as intended.

          <h2>2. What Cookies Do We Use?</h2>
          <p>
            Below we list the different types of Cookies that are used on the Site that you are visiting.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the extent any personal information is collected through first-party Cookies, our
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/privacy/policy/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
            applies and complements this Cookie Policy. Personal information
            collected through a third-party Cookie is subject to the privacy policy of that third
            party, and not our Privacy Policy.
          </p>

            <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              Analytics Cookies collect information about your use of the Site, and enable us to
              improve the way it works. For example, Analytics Cookies show us which are the most
              frequently visited pages on the Site, help us record any difficulties you have with the
              Site, and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. Analytics Cookies allow
              us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Site, rather than the usage of a single
              person. We use information from Analytics Cookies to analyze the Site traffic, but we do
              not examine this information for individually identifying information.

            Some of the network advertisers, ad agencies and other vendors we work with to serve ads

            provide us with information regarding the use of the Site and effectiveness of ads are
            members of the Network Advertising Initiatives, the Digital Advertising Alliance
            Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioural Advertising and/or the European
