							TheTimesCenter is available for public, private, nonprofit and corporate events. The Stage and the The Hall are priced and rented separately. Clients may choose to &ldquo;buy out&rdquo; any portion of the venue they are not using for their event to ensure exclusive presence in TheTimesCenter. Otherwise, any portion of the venue not rented or held as a &ldquo;buy out&rdquo; remains in our rental inventory and may be offered for rent to a separate event.
						</p>
						<p class="right_copy">
							Rental rates are set as basic “four-wall” rentals and are hourly, based on a minimum of six hours of time. Nonprofit rates are available as are package discounts for renting both The Stage and The Hall and for multiple days. Rental rates do not include the cost of additional required services such as technical labor, front-of-house staff, security and custodial personnel. A formal quote prepared by TheTimesCenter sales manager will include estimates for each of these labor departments as well as use of internal audio/visual inventories (lighting, video and audio). In addition, any outsourced equipment rentals, box office/ticketing services, dock fees, etc. will be billed back to the renter. When booking your event at TheTimesCenter, it is important to inform the booking and production staff of your event’s time line and technical needs in advance, in order for us to provide you with an accurate price quote.
