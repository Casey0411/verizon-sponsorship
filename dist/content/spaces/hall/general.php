	<p>A dramatic double stairwell leads guests to The Hall on the venue’s lower lobby. The Hall’s lobby offers soaring views of TheTimesCenter from below and is ideal for event receptions, registration or pre-event functions. Once guests come through the lower lobby, they enter into The Hall, a sprawling 5,000-square-foot space that boasts high ceilings, a wireless audio system, wall-mounted plasma TVs and drop-down projection screens and a discrete event lighting system perfect for panels, product displays or food stations. With the flip of a switch, The Hall can easily act as a simulcasting space for content from The Stage, allowing event planners to expand their attendance numbers. The Hall also includes a large caterer’s staging kitchen, making the space ideal for sit-down banquets of 390 or receptions that can accommodate as many as 500.</p>
	<p>As a flexible “blank palette” space, The Hall can be furnished and decorated to reflect your event needs or ambience. Catering is also available from a select list of approved companies to help you meet the needs of even the most discerning palates.</p>
