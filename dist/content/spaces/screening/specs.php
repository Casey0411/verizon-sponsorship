		<strong>Audio</strong>
		<br/>
		The audio system for screening films at TheTimesCenter is flexible in that it can be configured in a variety of ways depending on the scope and nature of the event. For a screening with talk-back, the main L/C/R speakers can be placed on the deck behind our perforated screen. In this configuration, any microphones required on stage will send solely to the surround speakers. Alternatively, if the screening event includes a musical performance, the PA can remain flown in the grid to accommodate the audio needs of both the performance and the film.
